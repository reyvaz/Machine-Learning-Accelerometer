## Introduction

This repository contains the R code for different machine learning algorithms. Accelerometer data is used to predict how well individuals perform weight-lifting exercises. The dataset comes from Veloso et al., (2013) and it contains data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell from 6 individuals.  

The dataset comprises information on 6 participants who were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the unilateral dumbbell biceps curl in five different ways: according to specification; throwing the elbows to the front; lifting the dumbbell only halfway; lowering the dumbbell only halfway; and throwing the hips to the front. More information on the dataset can be found [here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).   

The code in this repository processes data and constructs 3 different machine learning algorithms, including CART, Random Forest, and Boosted GBM to predict the way dumbbell biceps curls were performed.   

The training dataset is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv). And the test dataset is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv).    

* The rendered html version of the code is found  [here](https://reyvaz.github.io/MachineLearningWL/barbellRmd.html). 

* To reproduce the results place the downloaded data files in the same working directory as the [barbellRmd.Rmd](https://reyvaz.github.io/MachineLearningWL/barbellRmd.Rmd) file. Or alter the file paths for the data in the code accordingly.   

* The file [barbellRmd.md](barbellRmd.md) contains the code and output rendered in a markdown file.
